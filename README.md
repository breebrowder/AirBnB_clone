# AirBnB Clone Group Project- Cohort 14

## Description

#### Tasked to us by Holberton School, we will complete a clone of the AirBnB web application, composed of:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)rimester as well as learni  ng a few new concepts as we work on this project.

Note: The command interpreter must be able to repeatedly issue a prompt, accept input, parse an initial prefix off the received input, and dispatch toaction methods, passing them the remainder of the line as argument.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
5. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
6. Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7 or more)
7. All your files must be executable
8. The length of your files will be tested using wc
9. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
10. All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
11. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and p    ython3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
12. A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be    verified)

### Python Unit Tests
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files should end with a new line
3. All your test files should be inside a folder tests
4. You have to use the unittest module
5. All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
6. All your test files and folders should start by test_
7. Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
   e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
   e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
8. All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
9. You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
10. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
11. All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
12. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and p   ython3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
13. We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don‚Äôt miss any edge case

### Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

````
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
````

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

````
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
````

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode:
~~~~~~
$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
~~~~~~

#### FUNCTIONS OF THE CONSOLE(CLI)
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc‚Ä¶
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc‚Ä¶)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
